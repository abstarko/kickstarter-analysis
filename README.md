##An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
 
Louise is wanting to raise enough money for her play in the US which will estimate around $12,000. We have collected the data from Kickstarter which is a crowdfunding platoform where we can see over 4,000 campaigns that have raised money for projects similar to Louise's. We can see that many of the campaigns failed to hit their goal mark. We broke down our data to look at "theater" data specifically. 
Looking at our pivot table you can see that there were 525 successful theater Kickstarters.

When looking for the best time for Louise to launch her campaign we can see in our line chart that May was the most successful month. While, January, October, June, and July all had around the same number of failed campaign launches. When we filter our chart to theater, we can see that this is a very popular and successful type of campaign overall. We can see that June is a successful time to launch a campaign in this category, in which I would recommend to Louise to launch hers in the month of June.

Looking at data for plays in GB, since Louise showed interest in this market; budgeting 4,000 pounds. We used a box plot to look at the big picture. We can see that most plays had their campaign goals at less than half of what Louise's is. She should look at getting her play produced for less than 4,000 pounds, around 2,000 pounds would be more reasonable.

I would recommend that Louise kicks off her campaign in June in order to have the best chance of having a sucessful campaign. Though her goal of $12,000 in the US is high compared to other theater campaigns, it is not unattainable, with having 525 successful theater kickstarters out of 912. Incentives for donors would also be helpful. If she is to launch a campaign in GB, I would recommend cutting her goal in half in order to have a successful campaign.
